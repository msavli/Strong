About=Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen's content from https://github.com/morphgnt/strongs-dictionary-xml/downloads. \par\par The XML version of this work was prepared in 2006 by Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen (http://ulrikp.org) from an ASCII e-text version.  The XML version contains "real" UTF-8 Greek where the original ASCII e-text version had transliteration.  The XML has a stand-alone DTD which should be easy to follow. \par\par Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen welcomes bugfixes to the text.

By assigning numbers to each unique word in the Old and New Testaments and listing each word with its number, Strong produced a standard, still used today, for referencing definitions. Bible students, with little or no knowledge of Greek and Hebrew, are able to use Strong's numbers to learn about the Greek and Hebrew of the Bible. \par\par Based from https://gitlab.com/crosswire-bible-society/strongsgreek/ and translated to Slovenian language by Marjan Savli, marjan.savli@gmail.com. \par\par Public Domain -- Copy Freely
